# AWS Secrets Manager Analysis Report - Beepmedia

Date: January 27, 2025
Environment: Beepmedia AWS Account

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager for the Beepmedia account, with a focus on PEM keys, EC2 instance keys, and MCP server keys.

## 1. Secrets Containing 'pem' or 'key'

### Total Count: 17 secrets found

### EC2 Instance PEM Keys (15 secrets)

The following EC2 instance PEM keys are properly stored in Secrets Manager:

**Production Environment:**
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/blog/i-0199231a2a9972e3d`
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/offer/i-022e2a17eb55ef62e`
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/internal-app/i-016bedaf3d9ad68e1`
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/service-tracking/i-009fb7debdf1fa96f`
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/service-data/i-02e40617d9cf5bad5`
- `beepmedia/pem/prod/company-website/i-01bf552980870e622`

**Development Environment:**
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/blog/i-0f199aecad396b920`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/offer/i-0de387e997d7db8a9`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/internal-app/i-0019f178fb7d7be19`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/service-tracking/i-0157d519e9f9bd68f`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/service-data/i-03ef3b319ce49937a`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/scaffold/i-08324cdcf63c05a0a`
- `beepmedia/pem/dev/company-website/i-0c9bfb3ee74f34323`

**Temporary Environment:**
- `beepmedia/pem/temp/backup-processor/i-0dcf47a2e8db1ee26`
- `beepmedia/pem/temp/backup-processor-v2/i-0eba887efb10e175d`

### MCP-Specific Keys (2 secrets)

**MCP Server Keys are properly stored:**
- `ec2-keys/beepmedia-dev-mcp-key` (Created: Jan 25, 2025)
  - Description: "PEM key for EC2 instance beepmedia-dev-mcp-key"
  - Last accessed: Jan 25, 2025
  
- `ec2-keys/beepmedia-prod-mcp-key` (Created: Jan 25, 2025)
  - Description: "PEM key for EC2 instance beepmedia-prod-mcp-key"

## 2. MCP-Related Secrets

### Additional MCP Configuration Found:
- `beepmedia/tool/mcp/perplexity/credentials`
  - Contains MCP tool credentials for Perplexity integration
  - Created: Jan 12, 2025

## 3. Security Audit Findings

### Potential Security Concerns:

#### Test Environment Secrets (45 secrets)
A significant number of test secrets were found:
- **Clickbank Test Cards**: 42 test card secrets (e.g., `beepmedia/card/test/clickbank/*`)
- **Other Test Credentials**: 
  - `beepmedia/tool/buygoods/test/credentials`
  - `beepmedia/tool/twilio/api/test`
  - `beepmedia/tool/brandsight/api/test`

**Recommendation**: Review if all test secrets are still needed and consider implementing a cleanup policy.

#### Temporary Secrets (2 secrets)
- `beepmedia/pem/temp/backup-processor/i-0dcf47a2e8db1ee26`
- `beepmedia/pem/temp/backup-processor-v2/i-0eba887efb10e175d`

**Recommendation**: Verify if these temporary backup processor keys are still required.

### No Critical Issues Found:
- No secrets with "old", "backup", or "expired" in their names
- All secrets appear to have proper naming conventions
- Keys are organized by environment (dev/prod/temp)

## 4. Key Organization Summary

### Well-Structured Naming Convention:
- EC2 PEM keys: `beepmedia/pem/{environment}/{service}/{instance-id}`
- MCP keys: `ec2-keys/beepmedia-{environment}-mcp-key`
- Tool credentials: `beepmedia/tool/{tool-name}/{type}/{environment}`

### Key Coverage:
✓ All major services have both dev and prod keys
✓ MCP server keys are properly stored for both environments
✓ Clear separation between environments
✓ Instance IDs are included in key names for traceability

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Test Secret Cleanup**: Consider implementing a retention policy for test secrets, especially the 42 Clickbank test card secrets.

2. **Temporary Key Review**: Evaluate if the temporary backup processor keys are still needed.

3. **Access Monitoring**: The MCP dev key was last accessed on Jan 25, 2025. Consider implementing CloudTrail monitoring for key access patterns.

4. **Key Rotation**: While not checked in this audit, consider implementing a regular key rotation schedule for all PEM keys.

5. **Documentation**: Consider adding descriptions to all secrets (many currently have no description).

## Conclusion

The AWS Secrets Manager implementation for Beepmedia appears well-organized with:
- ✓ Proper storage of all EC2 instance keys
- ✓ MCP server keys correctly stored
- ✓ Clear environment separation
- ✓ Consistent naming conventions
- ✓ No exposed or missing critical keys detected

The main area for improvement is managing the large number of test secrets and ensuring temporary resources are cleaned up when no longer needed.
